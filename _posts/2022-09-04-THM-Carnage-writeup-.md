## [](#header-2)Foreword. 

This is a writeup of the carnage challenge from the Try Hack Me website. Basically it's a blue team challenge on the analysis of a C2 Cobalt Strique installation and communication system.

## [](#header-2)Introductions.

The objective of this challenge is to analyze and understand the functions and behavior of a Command and Control Cobalt Strike. 

The tools used will be the following 
- [Wireshark](https://www.wireshark.org/)
- [Brim](https://www.brimdata.io/)

## [](#header-2) Q1 :  What was the date and time for the first HTTP connection to the malicious IP?

filter by http in wireshark 

Wrieshark Filter
    - http

Awnser: 2021-09-24 16:44:38

## [](#header-2) Q2 : What is the name of the zip file that was downloaded?

On wireshark we can see the elements downloaded or manipulated via HTTP. And this via the following path. 

File -> Export Objects -> HTTP

once in this window, we filter by filename, and we get the unique zip document. 

Awnser: documents.zip

## [](#header-2) Q3 : What was the domain hosting the malicious zip file?

In the same place as the previous question (http export), you can see the hostname linked with the filename. 

Awnser: attirenepal.com

## [](#header-2) Q4 : Without downloading the file, what is the name of the file in the zip file?

By double clicking on the document.zip field in the HTTP Export section of the previous questions, Wireshark takes us directly to the location of the packet. 

Then you have to follow the content of the HTTP stream (Right click on packet -> Follow -> HTTP Stream). 

Here we can see the raw content of the HTTP transmission. And we can see the name of the file contained in document.zip

Awnser: chart-1530076591.xls

## [](#header-2) Q5 : What is the name of the webserver of the malicious IP from which the zip file was downloaded?

Still staying in the previous flow, we can analyze one of the HTTP packets. 

There is information related to the HTTP section of the TCP packet that we can analyze to solve this challenge. Here the section that interests us is server. 

Awnser: LiteSpeed

P.S: 

the server field is only visible when downloading the file, so you have to analyze the http packet that has the server's ip as its source, not the victim's. 


## [](#header-2) Q6 : What is the version of the webserver from the previous question?

On the same packet as the previous questions, in the filed x-powered-by you can see the PHP versions that powered the webserver.

Awnser: PHP/7.2.34

## [](#header-2) Q7 : Malicious files were downloaded to the victim host from multiple domains. What were the three domains involved with this activity?

For this question, it is necessary to make a small state of the existing. 

The malleable document was uploaded on September 24, 2021 at 16:44:06, so the infection can only start from that moment. 

The connections Cobalt strike, are done via https, thus via a communications ssl. 

We avony here two filter that we can apply to brim (ssl | sort() by ts). 

Filter by ssl and date . take in count 1 minute for the time the connexionx can be made and start see the interactions made in 16:45:06

Brim filter: 

> _path=="ssl" | id.resp_p 443 | cut ts,server_name | sort ts

![File name on the zip](/assets/Carnage/Q7-1.png)


after that use virus total to detect if the server_name is register or know to host the chart.xls file.

https://www.virustotal.com/gui/domain/new.americold.com/relations

Awnser: finejewels.com.au, thietbiagt.com, new.americold.com

P.S: 





## [](#header-2) Q8 : Which certificate authority issued the SSL certificate to the first domain from the previous question?

By adding the issuer field to the Brim filter of the previous question we can see the organization that issues the certificates.  

Brim filter: _path=="ssl" | id.resp_p 443 | cut ts,server_name,issuer | sort ts

Awnser: GoDaddy

## [](#header-2) Q9 : What are the two IP addresses of the Cobalt Strike servers? Use VirusTotal (the Community tab) to confirm if IPs are identified as Cobalt Strike C2 servers. (answer format: enter the IP addresses in sequential order)

on this questions , one ip is harder to find. the fisr one can be found with this idea. 

We know that CB server can have some suspicious behavior (alert). We also know that the HTTPS traffic is encryoted (ssl). 

And finally that a C2 normaly make more than a couple connextions. 

so with that in mind we can make the following filter in brim. 

Brim filter: 

> _path=="ssl" | alert | sort ts | uniq | cut id.resp_h | count() by id.resp_h | sort -r count

We test the first IP on virus total , and see in the comminity sections. 

https://www.virustotal.com/gui/ip-address/185.125.204.174/community

![Cobal Strike C2 found](/assets/Carnage/Q9-1.png)

I found the second one out of a guess, i guess that the second C2 server will share one first 8bytes of their IP. 

So i tried this filter in brim. 

> cut id.resp_h | sort id.resp_h | uniq

and i tried all the IP that start with 185. 

Awnser: 185.106.96.158, 185.125.204.174


## [](#header-2) Q10 : What is the Host header for the first Cobalt Strike IP address from the previous question?

In wireshark filter the ip and follow the firrst HTTP flux, go on the host field

Awnser: ocsp.verisign.com


## [](#header-2) Q11 : What is the domain name for the first IP address of the Cobalt Strike server? You may use VirusTotal to confirm if it's the Cobalt Strike server (check the Community tab).

Check again the same type of post that in question 9. 

![CB domain name](/assets/Carnage/Q11-1.png)

Awnser: survmeter.live

## [](#header-2) Q12 : What is the domain name of the second Cobalt Strike server IP?  You may use VirusTotal to confirm if it's the Cobalt Strike server (check the Community tab).

Do the same thing that in the previous question. 


## [](#header-2) Q13 : What is the domain name of the post-infection traffic?

In the export HTTP sections of wireshark multiple and some wierd interactions occure , and evry time its connected with maldivehost.net , by tring out this domain name in virus total, we found the C2 post exploit server. 

https://www.virustotal.com/gui/domain/maldivehost.net

Awnser: maldivehost.net


## [](#header-2) Q14 : What are the first eleven characters that the victim host sends out to the malicious domain involved in the post-infection traffic? 

In wireshark select tyhe first packet in EXPORT HTTP and follow the first HTTP packet. 

tha field that interest us is the POST field


![CB domain name](/assets/Carnage/Q-14.jpg)


Awnser: zLIisQRWZI9


## [](#header-2) Q15 : What was the length for the first packet sent out to the C2 server?

Go back to the HTTP packet and watch the lenght field

Awnser: 281



## [](#header-2) Q16 : What was the Server header for the malicious domain from the previous question?


go back to the capture taken in questions 14 and watch the server field.

Awnser: Apache/2.4.49 (cPanel) OpenSSL/1.1.1l mod_bwlimited/1.4



## [](#header-2) Q17 : The malware used an API to check for the IP address of the victimâ€™s machine. What was the date and time when the DNS query for the IP check domain occurred? (answer format: yyyy-mm-dd hh:mm:ss UTC)

for this one , we know that a api is use and that the DNS protocole is involved. so by tring this filter on brim. 

> _path=="dns" | api | cut query, ts

We found the following. 

![CB domain name](/assets/Carnage/Q17-1.jpg)


Awnser: 2021-09-24 17:00:04



## [](#header-2) Q18 :  What was the domain in the DNS query from the previous question?

the awnser is in the previous capture. 

Awnser: api.ipify.org


## [](#header-2) Q19 : Looks like there was some malicious spam (malspam) activity going on. What was the first MAIL FROM address observed in the traffic?


like other questions , we know that the SMTP protocol is involved , so , we can sort by snmp + sort by time in BRIM 

> _path=="smtp" | sort ts | cut ts , mailfrom

![CB domain name](/assets/Carnage/Q19-1.jpg)

## [](#header-2) Q19 : How many packets were observed for the SMTP traffic?


To see the number of SMTP packet you need to go to (in wireshark) 

> statisitic -> protocol hierarchie -> found SMP -> see in the number filed 

Awnser: 1439

thank for reading.
